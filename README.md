# ANSYS-USERMAT-Ramberg-Osgood
The following code contain an ANSYS USERMAT subroutine for a plasticity model of 3D solid elements or plane elements in plane strain or axisymmetric stress state.
The plasticity model is described by Ramberg-Osgood power law. The main advantage of this model compared to the default ones is it takes into account small plastic strains before reaching the yield stress.
