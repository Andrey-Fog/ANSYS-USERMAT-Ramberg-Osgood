# ANSYS-USERMAT-Ramberg-Osgood
The following code contain an ANSYS USERMAT subroutine for a plasticity model of 3D solid elements or plane elements in plane strain or axisymmetric stress state.
The plasticity model is described by Ramberg-Osgood power law. The main advantage of this model compared to the default ones is it takes into account small plastic strains before reaching the yield stress.  
Use [instructions](https://github.com/Andrey-Fog/ANSYS-USERMAT-Ramberg-Osgood/blob/main/USERMATDLL/Instructions.md) and [APDL script example](https://github.com/Andrey-Fog/ANSYS-USERMAT-Ramberg-Osgood/blob/main/USERMATDLL/APDL_example.txt) to compiling and attaching this library to ANSYS software.
